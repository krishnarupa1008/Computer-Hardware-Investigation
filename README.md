# Computer Hardware Investigation
1. Introduction <br><br>
   The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is considered to be the 'brain' of your computer. In this project, we investigate CPU performance for various CPU models produced by prominent manufacturers during the 1980s. The project explores the differences in performance amongst the most popular manufacturers in the dataset, as well as amongst the best performing manufacturers in the dataset. It explores the distributions of the numerical features in the dataset, looks at statistical characteristics of those features, and builds multiple predictive models designed to predict CPU performance based on important features. Finally, of the built models, the optimal model for predicting CPU performance is selected. <br><br>
3. Data <br><br>
   The data used in this project is sourced from the Machine Learning Repository of the University of California, Irvine:
   Feldmesser, J. (1987). Computer Hardware [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5830D.<br><br>

   The columns present in this dataset are as follows:
   - description of predictor variables and their meaning and influence on CPU performance <br><br>
5. Project Structure and Methodology <br><br>
6. Results and Analysis <br><br>
   - visualizations, evaluations, describe insightful parts of findings <br><br>
7. Challenges <br><br>
8. Future Work <br><br>
   - include the 0th col as a feature, encoded
   - repeat CPU performance investigation using current data (mid-2020s)
   - determine feature weights to see which impacted performance most and least
   - compare my model's MAE, MSE, RMSE with those of the article's authors' ERP predictions <br><br>
