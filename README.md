# Computer Hardware Investigation
1. Introduction <br><br>
   This project investigates CPU performance for various CPU models from multiple prominent manufacturers during the 1980s. It explores popular manufacturers and best performing manufacturers, and builds a model to predict CPU performance based on important features. <br><br>
3. Data and Context <br><br>
   - description of predictor variables and their meaning and influence on CPU performance <br><br>
4. Project Structure and Methodology <br><br>
5. Results and Analysis <br><br>
   - visualizations, evaluations, describe insightful parts of findings <br><br>
6. Challenges <br><br>
7. Future Work <br><br>
   - include the 0th col as a feature, encoded
   - repeat CPU performance investigation using current data (mid-2020s)
   - compare my model's MAE, MSE, RMSE with those of the article's authors' ERP predictions <br><br>
